My first thought after reading this question is that after the user is
prompted for an integer and it is read by my program if zero is entered then zero must be
printed and it will return false, then exit the program. Second of all, if its not zero I'm going to need a check function
in order to see if the number is in the range -999 to 999 inclusive so I'll convert this string into an integer, if not an error must appear, return false and exit the program.
If it is an accepted input I need to know if it is negative or not, this
function will scan the first character of the number as it is coming in as a string. If there is a minus sign then I know it is negative
and can start my new string variable with the word "Minus". I can count the length of the number as it comes in as
a string and if it started off with a minus I can find it's actual length by subtracting one from it's original length. If the length
was 3, then I'd have print the singular from of the first number which would be stored in a dictionary eg: the digit 4 is typed as "Four". I'd have to add "hundred" after as that
is generic for 3 digit numbers, however for the second digit I'd need to print the number in it's tens place eg: 3 would be "thirty". Finally for the last singular digit
I'd need to print a number in its singular form like if it was in it's hundredth place. If there was a zero in the tens place and singular place I'd leave the number as "whatever
hundred" eg: "four hundred". If there was a number in the singular place and not in the tens place it would be eg: "four hundred and three". If there were non zero numbers in both
the tens and singular places it would print eg: "four hundred and ninety five".
Sorry for the essay I couldn't help it.

    Please enter a string: This string is a palindrome.
