Pointers and a block of memory allocated at run-time may be used
by a lecturer as his/her class may increase and their program might have run out of memory and therefore couldn't run.
He/she may need more space to be able to compile/run their assignments etc and does not
want to have to manually change their own correction program in order to resolve this. That is why you
use malloc/calloc or if the program needs more memory when running it can use realloc.
